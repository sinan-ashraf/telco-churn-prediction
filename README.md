# 📞 Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning project to predict customer churn for a telecom company. It covers everything from data loading and preprocessing to model building, tuning, evaluation, and predictions on new customer data.

## 📌 Project Overview

✅ **Problem**: Predict if a customer will leave (churn) based on account and usage data.  
✅ **Dataset**: Telco Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle.  
✅ **Goals**:  
- Load and clean the dataset  
- Handle missing values and class imbalance  
- Build preprocessing pipelines  
- Train a **Random Forest Classifier**  
- Tune hyperparameters with **GridSearchCV**  
- Evaluate the model with precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC curve  
- Predict churn for new customer data

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **pandas** for data manipulation  
- **scikit-learn** for ML pipelines and modeling  
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for visualization  
- **Google Colab** for GPU-accelerated notebooks  

---

## 🧪 Results
- The pipeline was robust and handled missing and categorical data effectively.  
- Achieved a balanced model that can detect churners with good precision and recall.  
- The final model is ready to be deployed for real-world predictions.
